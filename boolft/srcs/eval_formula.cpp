 * - It pops the top two values from the stack, applies the specified logical operation,
 * and pushes the result back.
 * - The supported operations are:
 *   - '!' (NOT), '&' (AND), '|' (OR), '^' (XOR), '>' (IMPLICATION), '=' (EQUIVALENCE).
 * - Throws an exception if there are not enough operands.

 * This function evaluates a logical formula provided as a C-style string in RPN.
 * It processes each character in the string, pushing operands ('0' or '1')
 * onto a stack and applying operators as they are encountered.
 *
 * The evaluation proceeds as follows:
 * - For each character in the formula:
 *   - If it is '0' or '1', the corresponding boolean value is pushed onto the stack.
 *   - If it is a recognized operator, solve_rpn is called to process the operator and update the stack.
 *   - If an unrecognized symbol is encountered, an exception is thrown.
 * - After processing all characters, the stack must contain exactly one value,
 * 	 which is the result of the formula.
 * - Throws an exception if the formula is not well-formed (e.g., too many operands, unrecognized symbol).
 *
 * @param formula The logical formula in Reverse Polish Notation, as a C-style string.
 * @return The boolean result of evaluating the formula.
 * @throws BoolFtException If the formula is not well-formed, contains unrecognized symbols or if more than
 * 		   one element at stack at the end of the execution.
