 * It is especially useful for parsing or reconstructing logical expressions from RPN.
 *
 * The function works as follows:
 * - If the character at the given position is not an operator, it returns the
 * 	 current position (indicating a simple operand).
 * - If the operator is '!' (NOT), it recursively finds the start of its single operand.
 * - If the operator is '&' (AND) or '|' (OR), it recursively finds the start of both
 * 	 operands (first the right, then the left).
 * - If an unexpected operator is encountered, it throws an exception.
 *
 * @param expr The RPN expression string to search.
 * @param end The index of the operator whose subexpression's start is to be found.

 * - It verifies that the last character is a binary operator ('&' or '|').
 * - It uses the helper function `find_start` to locate the boundary between the two operands.

 * to the boundary) and the right operand (from the boundary to just before the root operator).
 * - It returns these two subexpressions as a pair of strings.

 * This function recursively transforms a logical expression in Reverse Polish Notation

 * negations only appear immediately before variables, and De Morgan's laws are used to "push"
 * negations inward.
 *
 * The function handles the following cases:
 * - If the expression is a single variable, it appends a '!' (NOT) operator (negation applied
 *   directly to the variable).
 * - If the root operator is '!' (NOT), it removes the negation (double negation is eliminated).
 * - If the root operator is '&' (AND) or '|' (OR), it splits the expression into its
 * 	 left and right subexpressions, recursively negates each, and combines them with the
 * 	 dual operator, following De Morgan's laws.
 *   - De Morgan's law for AND: \( \neg (A \land B) \equiv \neg A \lor \neg B \)
 *   - De Morgan's law for OR: \( \neg (A \lor B) \equiv \neg A \land \neg B \)
 *   - In RPN, this means replacing '&' with '|' (or vice versa) and negating the operands.
 * - Throws an exception if an unexpected operator or malformed expression is encountered.
 *
 * @param expr The RPN expression to be negated.

/**
 * @brief Applies a logical operator to the top elements of an RPN expression stack,

 *
 * This function processes both unary and binary logical operators on a stack of RPN
 * subexpressions. It is designed to work with expressions in Negation Normal Form (NNF),
 * and it handles the following operators:
 * - '!' (NOT, unary): Applies negation to the top element using `nnf_apply_neg`.
 * - '&' (AND, binary): Combines the top two elements with an AND operator.
 * - '|' (OR, binary): Combines the top two elements with an OR operator.
 * - '>' (IMPLICATION): Translates "A implies B" to "¬A ∨ B" in NNF.
 * - '=' (EQUIVALENCE): Translates "A ≡ B" to "(A ∧ B) ∨ (¬A ∧ ¬B)" in NNF.
 * - '^' (XOR): Translates "A XOR B" to "(A ∧ ¬B) ∨ (¬A ∧ B)" in NNF.
 *
 * For binary operators, the function pops the top two elements, constructs the appropriate
 * NNF expression, and pushes the result back onto the stack. For the unary operator '!',
 * it pops the top element, applies negation, and pushes the result.
 *
 * The function throws exceptions if there are not enough elements on the stack for the
 * given operator, or if an unknown operator is encountered.
 *
 * @param fnc Reference to the stack of RPN subexpressions.
