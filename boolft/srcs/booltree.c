/**
 * @brief Inserts a new element into a doubly linked stack.
 *
 * This function allocates memory for a new stack element, initializes its value,
 * and links it into an existing doubly linked stack structure. The new element is
 * inserted after the current parent element, and all pointers are updated accordingly.
 *
 * @param value The boolean value to be stored in the new stack element.
 * @param parent A double pointer to the current top (or parent) of the stack. If the stack is empty,
 *
 * @return A pointer to the newly created stack element on success, or NULL if memory allocation fails.
 *
 * @note
 *
 * If *parent is NULL, the new element becomes the first element in the stack.
 * This function does not update the external reference to the stack's head or tail; it only
 * returns the pointer to the newly created element.

/**
 * @brief Clears the stack and returns a specified error code.
 *
 * This utility function is intended for error-handling scenarios where an unrecoverable

 * that any dynamically allocated memory associated with the stack is properly freed,
 * preventing memory leaks before propagating the error code up the call stack.
 *
 * @param tail Double pointer to the stack's topmost element (tail). This allows the function
 *             to clear the entire stack using @ref clear_stack and set the caller's stack
 *             pointer to NULL.
 * @param error The integer error code to be returned. This value typically represents the
 *              specific error condition encountered by the calling function.
 *
 * @return The same error code provided as input, allowing for streamlined error propagation.

 * @note
 * - This function is designed to be called when an operation cannot be completed due to
 *   a fatal error (e.g., invalid input, memory allocation failure, or logical inconsistency).
 * - After this function is called, the stack is guaranteed to be empty and the pointer set to NULL.
